Step 1
Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.

Step 2
Heat 1 1/2 to 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.

Step 3
Dip the chicken pieces into the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, and again into the flour mixture.

Step 4
Test the oil to make sure it is hot enough: a small amount of flour dropped in should sizzle. Place 10 pieces of chicken into the hot oil; cook until golden brown, about 8 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on a paper towel lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken.
